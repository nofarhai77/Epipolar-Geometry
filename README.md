# Epipolar-Geometry

This program estimates the relationship between two camera views using the epipolar geometry concepts. Written as a assignment for the course Fundamentals of Computer Graphics, Image Processing, and Vision (Tel Aviv University).

Epipolar geometry is the geometry of stereo vision. When two cameras view a 3D scene from two distinct positions, there are a number of geometric relations between the 3D points and their projections onto the 2D images that lead to constraints between the image points.
